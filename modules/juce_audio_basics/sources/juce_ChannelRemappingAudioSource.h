/**
    An AudioSource that takes the audio from another source, and re-maps its
    input and output channels to a different arrangement.

    You can use this to increase or decrease the number of channels that an
    audio source uses, or to re-order those channels.

    Call the reset() method before using it to set up a default mapping, and then
    the setInputChannelMapping() and setOutputChannelMapping() methods to
    create an appropriate mapping, otherwise no channels will be connected and
    it'll produce silence.
